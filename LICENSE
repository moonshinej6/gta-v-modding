GTA 5 MOD MENU 2026 🔥🎯

Undetected GTA V cheat/menu for PC — keyless options for Story Mode & careful Online play (February 2026).  
Silent features, vehicle spawn, recovery tools, teleport, protections, money loops (low-key), ESP & more 💀

Standalone/external .exe or injector-based — run as admin and load into game.  
Works on latest GTA V Enhanced/Expanded (v1.71+ patches, BattlEye active in Online).  
Status: Low-risk in solo/invite-only (community tested, use HWID spoof & no rage in public) 🟢

Why this menu dominates in 2026  
- Easy launch: .exe as admin → GTA V → menu opens (Insert/F4/F5)  
- Legit configs: humanized options to avoid reports, visibility checks  
- BattlEye bypass in top menus (private or paid tiers) — HWID spoof built-in  
- Stream-safe: overlays hidden from OBS/recordings  
- Frequent updates for new patches, DLCs & anti-cheat changes  
- Free & paid variants available — no key for basics  
- Windows 10/11 64-bit only (Rockstar Launcher / Steam / Epic)  

Core Features — realistic & powerful

Recovery Tools        — money loops ($1M–$10M safe methods: bunker/nightclub), RP boost, unlocks, stats edit (low amounts to avoid flags) ★★★★★

ESP / Player Info     — player boxes/names/distance (external/low-key, risky in public) ★★★★☆

Pro Tips:  
- Always admin mode  
- Disable antivirus temporarily (normal for menus)  
- Use solo/invite-only for recovery/money — public = high report risk  
- Limit money/RP gains ($5–10M max per session) — Rockstar flags big jumps  
- For Online: Cherax/Lexis safest paid, YimMenu V2 free but risky (inject via Xenos)  

Supported Platforms (February 2026)  
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)  
- Latest GTA V Enhanced (BattlEye in Online)

"Protections block most griefers — streamproof keeps Twitch clean"
